# Pixel-Panic
In Pixel Panic, the player controls a character who must navigate through a series of levels that resemble classic video game worlds such as Super Mario Bros are glitched and filled with random bugs that affect the gameplay.


The players have to complete the levels with bugs it's going to use diferent mechanics. (At the momento only have one level type based on a tutorial of pygame on Youtube)


To win each level, the player must collect a certain number of pixels (which are scattered throughout the level) before time runs out. If the player fails to collect enough pixels or runs out of time, they must restart the level.

As the player progresses through the game, the levels become increasingly difficult and the glitches more intense. The ultimate goal is to reach the end of the game and defeat the final boss (Not finish), who has the power to permanently erase the game's save data if the player fails to defeat them.
